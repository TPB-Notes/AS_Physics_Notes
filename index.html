<h2 id="forces-and-motion">Forces and motion</h2>



<h3 id="constant-acceleration-equations">Constant acceleration equations</h3>

<p>The constant acceleration equations use the following variables</p>

<ul>
<li>v Final velocity</li>
<li>u Initial velocity</li>
<li>a Acceleration</li>
<li>t Time for the change in velocity</li>
<li>s Displacement during the velocity change</li>
</ul>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3234">v = u + at \\ v^2 = u^2 + 2as \\ s = \frac{1}{2}(u + v)t \\ s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \\ s = vt - \frac{1}{2}at^2</script></p>

<p>The final equation is not required for this course.</p>



<h3 id="free-fall-and-projectile-motion">Free fall and projectile motion</h3>

<p><strong>Free fall</strong> The acceleration a body feels when falling in the presence of a gravitational field</p>

<p>Objects of different masses fall at the same rate under the influence of gravity, this is because the acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the net force, but inversely proportional to its mass.</p>

<p><strong>Trajectory</strong> The path of any moving object</p>

<p><strong>Projectile</strong> An object that is given an initial force, and then allowed to move freely through space</p>

<p><strong>Parabola</strong> The name given to the shape of a curve which a projectile follows when gravity is the only force acting upon it</p>

<p>In the real world air resistance also acts on projectiles, however this is ignored in order to allow the problems to be solved using the constant acceleration equations.</p>

<p>To solve a problem, the components of motion are split into two parts, horizontal and vertical.</p>



<h3 id="measurement-of-g">Measurement of g</h3>

<p><strong>Light gate</strong> A device which measures the time between a beam of light being broken and being restored.</p>

<p><strong>Motion sensor</strong> Record displacement at regular time intervals</p>

<p>Both of these devices can be used to determine an experimental value for g.</p>

<p>Measurements can either be direct or indirect</p>

<ul>
<li>Direct measurement is measurement which does not require manipulation, such as time a falling object</li>
<li>Indirect measurement requires manipulation, such as measuring the period of pendulum and rearranging to find g</li>
</ul>

<p>When explaining an investigation, state the following</p>

<ul>
<li>The measurements to be taken</li>
<li>The equipment with which to take the measurements</li>
<li>The variables required to determine g</li>
<li>The sources of uncertainty in the measurements</li>
<li>The possible methods to minimise uncertainty</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="required-method-use-of-a-trap-door-and-an-electromagnet-to-determine-g">Required method- Use of a trap door and an electromagnet to determine g</h4>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong> <br>
An electromagnet supports a steel ball.  <br>
The electromagnet is on the same circuit as a timer.</p>

<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>

<p>When a switch is toggled the ball begins to fall a known distance, and the timer on the same circuit begins.</p>

<p>The ball falls onto a trap door, stopping the timer.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>The variables are the distance fallen, s, and the time taken, t.</p>

<p>Using the constant acceleration acceleration s = 0.5at<sup>2<sup></sup></sup></p>

<p>For any values of s and t we can then find a value for acceleration due to gravity.</p>

<p>Alternatively we could use the inferior and inaccurate method of drawing a graph of s against t<sup>2</sup> which would have a gradient of a/2.</p>

<p><strong>Methods to increase accuracy and reduce error</strong></p>

<p>In order to increase the accuracy of the experiment we could take repeat readings to find a mean value for t, and measure t across different heights.</p>



<h3 id="car-stopping-distances">Car stopping distances</h3>

<p><strong>Stopping distance</strong> The total distance that a vehicle travels before it stops</p>

<p><strong>Thinking distance</strong> The distance a vehicle travels between the operator seeing the hazard and applying the brakes</p>

<p><strong>Braking distance</strong> The distance that a vehicle travels between its brakes being applied and it coming to rest</p>

<h3 id="force-and-the-newton">Force and the Newton</h3>

<p><strong>Resultant force</strong> A single force which has the same effect as the sum of all forces acting on a body <br>
<strong>Thrust</strong> A term used for the driving force provided by a jet engine <br>
<strong>Drag</strong> A force which acts in the opposite direction to motion, impeding it. Also called the dissipative force</p>

<p>Types of forces</p>

<ul>
<li>Contact- Two bodies touch when their repulsive molecular forces equal the force that is trying to bring them together</li>
<li>Friction- When two bodies are in contact their attractive molecular forces try to prevent their common surfaces moving relative to each other</li>
<li>Tension- The force exerted by a body when it is stretched. It is due to attractive molecular forces</li>
<li>Compression- The force exerted by a body when it is compressed. It is due to repulsive molecular forces</li>
<li>Fluid upthrust- The force exerted by a fluid on a body because of the weight of the fluid that has been displaced by the body. Archimedes’ principle states that the upthrust force is equal to the weight of fluid displaced.</li>
<li>Electrostatic- Attractive and repulsive forces due to bodies being charged</li>
<li>Magnetic- Attractive and repulsive forces due to moving electric charges</li>
<li>Electromagnetic- Attractive and repulsive forces due to bodies being charged. Contact, friction, tension, compression, fluid upthrust, electrostatic, and magnetic forces are all forms of electromagnetic foce</li>
<li>Weak nuclear- The force responsible for nuclear decay</li>
<li>Electro-weak- It is thought that both the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces are both forms of this fundamental force</li>
<li>Strong nuclear- This fundamental force holds protons and neutrons together in the nucles</li>
<li>Gravitational- The fundamental force exerted on a body due to its mass</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="dynamics">Dynamics</h3>

<p><strong>Dynamics</strong> A branch of mechanics concerned with the motion of bodies under the action of forces</p>

<p>While dynamics is the study of the motion of bodies and the forces that cause the movement, kinematics is the study of movement without any reference to external forces.</p>

<p>The normal contact force, or reaction force, acts perpendicular to the point of contact against a surface.</p>

<p>When two surfaces move next to each other, each surface is slightly deformed, meaning that the bonds between the atoms are stretched and compressed.</p>

<p>Friction occurs within all fluids.</p>



<h4 id="free-body-diagrams">Free body diagrams</h4>

<p>Free body diagrams help to determine the net force on a body</p>

<p>They should always contain</p>

<ul>
<li>The body or point upon which the forces are acting</li>
<li>The direction in which each force acts</li>
<li>The type of each force</li>
<li>The size of each force</li>
</ul>

<p>The diagram below shows the free body diagram for an object on a rough inclined plane</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lMCD8.png" alt="Free body diagram" title=""></p>



<h3 id="drag-and-terminal-velocity">Drag and terminal velocity</h3>

<p><strong>Fluid</strong> A substance which has no fixed shape, and yields easily to external pressure</p>

<p>Any object which moves through a fluid experiences a dissipative drag force. <br>
The drag force is called aerodynamic drag when the fluid is a gas, and hydrodynamic drag when the fluid is a liquid.</p>

<p>The frictional force on a body moving through a fluid is given by </p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3235">F_d = \frac{1}{2} \rho C_d AV^2</script></p>

<p>Where  <br>
F<sub>d</sub> is the drag force (N) <br>
ρ is the density of the fluid (kg m<sup>-3</sup>) <br>
C<sub>d</sub> is the coefficient of drag <br>
A is the cross sectional area of the object (m<sup>2</sup>) <br>
V is the velocity of the object (ms<sup>-1</sup>)</p>

<p>For an object of constant size, moving through a fluid of uniform density the drag force, F<sub>d</sub>, is proportional the the square of the velocity, V<sup>2</sup>.</p>



<h4 id="terminal-velocity">Terminal velocity</h4>

<p>When an object falls from a height, it initially accelerates because the force of gravity is greater than the resistive force. <br>
As it accelerates, its velocity increases, and as such the drag force increases proportional to the square of the velocity. The increase in drag force results in a decrease in acceleration.</p>

<p>When the drag force is equal to the force of gravity, the object is at terminal velocity.</p>



<h3 id="equilibrium">Equilibrium</h3>

<p><strong>Equilibrium</strong> If the resultant force acting on an object is 0, the object is said to be in equilibrium</p>

<p>The resultant force can be found by splitting each of the forces acting on a body into their respective horizontal and vertical components, before finding the resultant in each axis.</p>



<h3 id="turning-forces">Turning forces</h3>

<p>The turning effect of a force is called a moment</p>

<p><strong>Couple</strong> Two equal antiparallel forces acting to produce rotation with no linear motion <br>
<strong>Torque</strong> The torque of a couple is defined as the moment or turning effect produced by a couple</p>

<p>The moment is the force multiplied by the perpendicular distance from the pivot around which it is acting</p>



<h4 id="principle-of-moments">Principle of moments</h4>

<p>The principle of moments states that when in equilibrium the sum of the clockwise moments is equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments.</p>

<p>The resultant force must also be 0 to ensure that there is no translational acceleration.</p>



<h3 id="centre-of-mass">Centre of mass</h3>

<p><strong>Centre of mass</strong> The centre of mass of an object is the single point at which all of an objects mass can be assumed to be situated. For a symmetrical body of uniform density it is always situated at the centre of the object.</p>



<h4 id="method-for-determining-the-mass-of-irregular-shapes">Method for determining the mass of irregular shapes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Make two holes in the objects</li>
<li>Hang the object from each of the holes and draw a line from the hole parallel to the ground</li>
<li>The centre of mass is the point at which the lines cross</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Centre of gravity</strong> The centre of gravity is the single point through which the entire weight of the object can be thought to act</p>

<p>The stability of objects are determined by the position of their centres of mass and their base area. <br>
Objects with a low centre of mass and wide base area are more stable.</p>



<h3 id="density">Density</h3>

<p><strong>Density</strong> The mass per unit volume of a substance</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3236">\rho = \frac{m}{v} \quad (kg\ m^-3)</script></p>



<h3 id="pressure">Pressure</h3>

<p><strong>Pressure</strong> The force per unit area</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3237">P = \frac{F}{A} \quad (\frac{N}{m^2}) \ (Pa) </script></p>

<p>For hydrostatic pressure</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3238">P = h\rho g</script> <br>
Where  <br>
h is the depth of the fluid (m) <br>
ρ is the density of the fluid (kg m<sup>-3</sup>) <br>
g is acceleration due to gravity (ms<sup>-2</sup>)</p>



<h3 id="work-and-the-joule">Work and the joule</h3>

<p><strong>Work</strong> The work done is the product of the force and the distance moved by the force in the direction of movement</p>

<p>One joule is defined as the energy exerted when a force of one newton is applied over a displacement of one metre.</p>

<p>The area under the curve of a force-distance graph is equal to the work done</p>



<h3 id="the-conservation-of-energy">The conservation of energy</h3>

<p>Forms of energy</p>

<ul>
<li>Kinetic energy- Energy possessed by a moving body</li>
<li>Nuclear energy- Energy transferred during a nuclear reaction</li>
<li>Gravitational potential energy- Energy possessed by anything under the influence of a gravitational force</li>
<li>Elastic potential energy- Energy possessed by an object which has been stretched</li>

</ul>

<p>2nd law of thermodynamics <br>
The entropy of any isolated system always increases</p>

<p>3rd law of thermodynamics <br>

<h3 id="potential-and-kinetic-energy">Potential and kinetic energy</h3>

<p>The kinetic energy, E<sub>k</sub> possessed by an object in motion is given by</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3239">E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 </script></p>

<p>The gravitational potential energy, GPE, stored in an object by virtue of its position in a gravitational field is given by</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3240">GPE = mg\Delta h</script></p>

<p>When an object falls under the influence of a gravitational force, its gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.</p>

<p>When an object is launched upwards with an initial velocity, and therefore an initial kinetic energy, its kinetic energy is converted to gravitational potential energy until it has 0 velocity, and begins to fall.</p>



<h3 id="power-and-the-watt">Power and the watt</h3>

<p><strong>Power</strong> The rate of work done (W) (J s<sup>-1</sup>)</p>

<p>The power produced by an object moving at speed v under a force F produces a power given by</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3241">P = Fv</script></p>



<h3 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h3>

<p><strong>Efficiency</strong> The efficiency of a process is the ratio of useful work performed to the total energy expended</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3242">Efficiency = \frac{Useful\ output\ energy}{Total\ input\ energy}</script></p>



<h3 id="deformation-of-materials">Deformation of materials</h3>

<p><strong>Deformation</strong> The change in shape or size of an object</p>

<p><strong>Elasticity</strong> The tendency of a body to resume it’s original shape or size once a deforming force or stress has  been removed</p>

<p><strong>Elastic deformation</strong> When a body returns to it’s original shape once a stress, strain, or force is removed</p>

<p><strong>Plastic deformation</strong> When a body does not return to it’s original shape once a stress, strain, or force is removed</p>



<h4 id="tensile-forces">Tensile forces</h4>

<p>Tensile forces  cause tension in an object. <br>
If there is tension in a wire, then   there must be an equal and opposite force at both ends. <br>
These forces will cause the wire to increase in length, a positive extension.</p>

<p>Compressive forces act towards each other and have the opposite effect.</p>



<h4 id="measuring-the-stretch-of-a-wire">Measuring the stretch of a wire</h4>

<ul>
<li>Attach a wire to a clamp</li>
<li>Run the wire horizontally, over the edge of a surface through a pulley</li>
<li>Attach mass to the wire so that it is taught</li>
<li>Place a mark on the wire, and a ruler underneath it inline with the mark</li>
<li>Progressively add more mass, measuring how far the mark moves</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="elastic-limit">Elastic limit</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.cyberphysics.co.uk/graphics/graphs/stress_strain2.gif" alt="Elastic limit" title=""></p>

<p>The important points are</p>

<ul>
<li>The limit of proportionality</li>
<li>The elastic limit</li>
<li>The fracture point</li>
<li>The plastic deformation region</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="hookes-law">Hooke’s law</h3>

<p><strong>Hooke’s law</strong> The extension of an object is proportional to the force that causes it, provided that the elastic limit is not exceeded</p>

<p>Hooke’s law states</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3243">F = kx</script></p>

<p>The force (N) is equal to the spring constant (Nm<sup>-1</sup>) multiplied by the extension (m).</p>



<h4 id="springs-in-series-and-combination">Springs in series and combination</h4>

<p>When springs are suspended in series, each spring experiences the same pull from the weight of the mass it supports. Therefore each spring extends the same amount as an individual spring would do.</p>

<p>When springs support a weight by combination, they share the load and therefore are not stretched as much as if they were supporting the weight themselves.</p>



<h4 id="force-extension-graphs-and-work-done">Force extension graphs and work done</h4>

<p>As stated previously, work done = force x distance. <br>
Therefore, the area under a force-extension graph is equal to the work done in applying the extension. <br>
This work done is equal to the elastic potential energy stored within the extended object.</p>

<p>Prior to the limit of proportionality, the area under the curve forms a triangle</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3244">W = \frac{1}{2}Fx\\ as\ F = kx, we\ also\ have \\W = \frac{1}{2}kx^2</script></p>

<p>Usually we plot the independent variable on the x-axis, and the dependent on the y-axis. <br>
Force extension graphs break this convention.</p>

<p>If we plot extension on the x, the gradient is then the spring constant</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3245">k = \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta x}</script></p>

<h3 id="the-young-modulus">The Young modulus</h3>

<p><strong>Stress</strong> Force per unit area (N m<sup>-2</sup>) (Pa) Given the symbol σ</p>

<p><strong>Strain</strong> Extension per unit length (No units) Given the symbol ε</p>

<p>The young modulus is the ratio of stress to strain</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3308">Young\ modulus = \frac{tensile\ stress}{tensile\ strain} \\   E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}</script></p>

<p>A stiff material needs more force to deform in comparison to a soft material. The Young’s modulus is a measure of the stiffness of a solid.</p>

<p><strong>Strength</strong> The amount of force that a material can withstand and still recover its original shape</p>

<p><strong>Hardness</strong> The relative resistance that the surface of a material imposes against the penetration of a harder body</p>

<p><strong>Toughness</strong> The amount of energy that a material can absorb before fracturing</p>

<p>As we know that</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3323">stress = \frac{force}{cross-sectional\ area}</script></p>

<p>and</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3337">strain = \frac{extension}{original\ length}</script></p>

<p>we can write the Young’s modulus as</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3407">\begin{align}
Young\ modulus &= \frac{\frac{force}{cross-sectional\ area}}{\frac{extension}{original\ length}} \\ 
&= \frac{force \times original\ length}{extension \times cross-sectional\ area} \\
&= \frac{Fl}{eA} 
\end{align}</script></p>



<h4 id="investigating-young-modulus">Investigating Young modulus</h4>

<p>Searles apparatus</p>

<ul>
<li>Measures the original length of a wire before any load</li>
<li>Measures the diameter of the wire with a micrometre</li>
<li>Force of tension is then increased by adding masses to the right side</li>
<li>Extension is measured after each new mass is added</li>
<li><p>A  stress vs strain graph is plotted from the data</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/496b25e74f.png" alt="enter image description here" title=""></p></li>
</ul>

<p>With a ruler and mass</p>

<ul>
<li>Attach a wire to a clamp</li>
<li>Run the wire horizontally, over the edge of a surface through a pulley</li>
<li>Attach mass to the wire so that it is taught</li>
<li>Place a mark on the wire, and a ruler underneath it inline with the mark</li>
<li>Progressively add more mass, measuring how far the mark moves</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the collected values to calculate the Young modulus of the wire</p>

<p><strong>Ultimate tensile strength</strong> The maximum stress a material can withstand while being pulled or stretched before it breaks</p>

<p><strong>Elastic hysteresis</strong> The process in which energy is dissipated by the loading and unloading of a material</p>



<h3 id="categorisation-of-materials">Categorisation of materials</h3>

<p><strong>Ductile</strong> A ductile material can be drawn into wires and will show plastic deformation under tensile stress before it breaks</p>

<p><strong>Malleable</strong> A malleable material can be hammered and beaten into flat sheets and will show extensive plastic deformation when subjected to compressive forces</p>

<p><strong>Brittle</strong> A brittle material will break with very little plastic deformation</p>

<p><strong>Polymeric</strong> A polymeric material has long chains of molecules that allow for elastic deformation</p>

<p>When a ductile material is stretched, it will increase in length and decrease in cross sectional area to compensate for this. This process is known as necking.</p>

<h3 id="resistance-and-ohms-law">Resistance and Ohm’s law</h3>

<h4 id="ohms-law">Ohm’s law</h4>

<p>The current through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across it, provided that physical conditions, such as temperature, remain constant.</p>

<h4 id="resistance">Resistance</h4>

<p><strong>Resistance</strong> The ratio of voltage applied to a material to the current which flows through it (Ω)</p>

<p>Resistance depends upon the type of material, and the volume of the material. <br>
Longer wires will have a smaller potential gradient. The longer the wire, the lower the ‘voltage per metre’. This will lower the drift velocity and hence result in a smaller current.  <br>
This means that the resistance of the wire increases in direct proportion to the length of the wire.</p>

<p>Resistance is inversely proportional to the cross sectional area of the wire. There is no change in potential gradient, but there is a large volume of electrons that are available to flow at the same drift velocity.</p>

<p>Resistance also depends on the temperature of the wire. <br>
When the temperature increases, the fixed metal ions vibrate more creating an obstacle for the flow of electrons.</p>

<h3 id="resistivity">Resistivity</h3>

<p><strong>Resistivity</strong> A measure of the resisting power of a material to the flow of electric current through it</p>

<h3 id="the-potential-divider">The potential divider</h3>

<p><strong>Potential divider</strong> A circuit which uses two resistors to split up or divide the voltage of the supply in a chosen ratio </p>

<h4 id="using-a-variable-resistor">Using a variable resistor</h4>

<h4 id="using-a-thermistor-in-a-temperature-control-circuit">Using a thermistor in a temperature control circuit</h4>

<h4 id="using-a-light-dependent-resistor-in-an-illumination-control-circuit">Using a light-dependent resistor in an illumination control circuit</h4>

<p>An LDR has a high resistance when the incident light intensity is very low. As the intensity of the falling light increases the resistance falls. <br>
This means that the LDR can be used to switch lights on as the incident light decreases.</p>



<h3 id="internal-resistance">Internal resistance</h3>

<p><strong>Internal resistance</strong> The internal resistance of a source of e.m.f is the resistance to electric current of the materials inside a cell</p>

<p><strong>Terminal p.d</strong> The potential difference recorded across the terminals of a cell. </p>

<p><strong>Lost volts</strong> The difference between e.m.f and the terminal p.d when charge flows in a cell</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3930">\begin{align} \mathscr{E} &= IR + Ir \\ &= I(R + r) \\ &= V_R + Ir\end{align}</script></p>

<p>So when no current flows, I = 0 and ε  = V<sub>R</sub></p>

<p>The e.m.f and internal resistance of a cell are constant values. It is therefore possible to have a situation in which different currents will flow for different load resistances. <br>
The values can be solved using simultaneous equations.</p>

<h4 id="finding-the-internal-resistance-of-a-cell">Finding the internal resistance of a cell</h4>

<p>I we rearrange ε = IR + Ir and substitute V<sub>R</sub> for IR we have V<sub>R</sub> = -Ir + ε .</p>

<p>This equations has the form y = mx + c, so if we plot a graph of V against I we will have a straight line with negative gradient and positive intercepts. <br>
The y intercept will be equal to the e.m.f of the cell. <br>
The gradient of the graph equals the internal resistance of the cell.</p>



<h3 id="circuit-analysis">Circuit analysis</h3>



<h4 id="analysis-of-series-and-parallel-hybrid-circuits">Analysis of series and parallel hybrid circuits</h4>

<p>Many circuits have a parallel branch that is connected in series with other components.  <br>

<p>The overall e.m.f available to the circuit can be found in the same manner as for a series circuit.</p>

<h3 id="wave-motion">Wave motion</h3>

<p>Waves transfer energy from one place to another without any net transfer of matter.</p>

<p>Waves can be longitudinal or transverse.  <br>
In longitudinal waves the vibrations are parallel to the direction of energy transfer, resulting in the formation of compressions and rarefactions. <br>
In transverse waves the vibrations are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer.</p>

<p><strong>Progressive waves</strong> Waves which transfer energy away from a source</p>

<h3 id="wave-terminology">Wave terminology</h3>

<p><strong>Wavelength</strong> The wavelength, λ (m) of a wave is the distance between two successive identical points that have the same pattern of oscillation.</p>

<p><strong>Period</strong> The period, T (s), is the time taken for the wave to complete one pattern of oscillation</p>

<p><strong>Frequency</strong> The frequency, f (Hz), is the number of oscillations per unit time at any point. It is the inverse of the period of the wave</p>

<p><strong>Displacement</strong> The displacement, x (m), is the distance of any part of the wave from its mean position</p>

<p><strong>Amplitude</strong> The amplitude, x<sub>0</sub> (m), is the maximum displacement that the wave reaches from its mean position</p>

<p><strong>Phase difference</strong> The phase difference, φ (rad), the difference in the pattern of vibration between two points in the wave. Two points that have exactly the same pattern of oscillation are said to be in phase, there is zero phase difference between them</p>

<h3 id="using-an-oscilloscope">Using an oscilloscope</h3>

<p>An oscilloscope displays a voltage-time signal and can be used as a voltmeter to display and measure the output from a microphone or signal generator.</p>

<p>The frequency of a wave displayed on an oscilloscope can be determined if you know the settings of the time base on the oscilloscope. <br>
This is the time taken for the luminous dot produced by the CRT to move a horizontal distance of 1cm across the oscilloscope’s screen.</p>

<h4 id="oscilloscope-controls">Oscilloscope controls</h4>

<p>Each horizontal division on the oscilloscope represents a unit of time. The time base control varies the seconds or milliseconds per division. <br>
The uncertainty in the frequency measurement can be reduced by altering the time base such that one full wave has the widest possible range in the x direction.</p>

<p>If the time base is turned off, the spot no longer moves across the screen. This is useful for observing the intensity of the wave.</p>

<p>Each vertical division on the oscilloscope screen represents a unit of voltage. The sensitivity control varies the volts per division.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3968">v = \frac{\lambda}{T}</script></p>

<p>We know that the frequency is the reciprocal of the period, so this can also be written</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-3975">v = f \times \lambda</script></p>

<h4 id="energy-transfer-by-waves">Energy transfer by waves</h4>

<p>A progressive wave transfers energy from one place to another. From a point source producing waves, this energy spreads out in all directions.</p>

<p><strong>Intensity</strong> Power per unit area (W m<sup>-2</sup>)</p>

<p>The intensity is given by</p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-4008">\begin{align} intensity = \frac{\frac{energy}{time}}{area} \\ = \frac{power}{area}\end{align}</script></p>

<p>If the power spreads out equally in all directions this can be written</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-4018">intensity = \frac{power}{4\pi r^2}</script></p></div></body>
