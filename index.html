<h2 id="forces-and-motion">Forces and motion</h2>



<h3 id="constant-acceleration-equations">Constant acceleration equations</h3>

<p>The constant acceleration equations use the following variables</p>

<ul>
<li><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5772">v</script> Final velocity</li>
<li><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5773">u</script> Initial velocity</li>
<li><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5774">a</script> Acceleration</li>
<li><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5775">t</script> Time for the change in velocity</li>
<li><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5776">s</script> Displacement during the velocity change</li>
</ul>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5777">v = u + at \\ v^2 = u^2 + 2as \\ \begin{align} s &= \frac{1}{2}(u + v)t \\&= ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2 \\&= vt - \frac{1}{2}at^2 \end{align}</script></p>

<p>The final equation is not required for this course.</p>



<h3 id="free-fall-and-projectile-motion">Free fall and projectile motion</h3>

<p><strong>Free fall</strong> The acceleration a body feels when falling in the presence of a gravitational field</p>

<p>Objects of different masses fall at the same rate under the influence of gravity, this is because the acceleration of a body is directly proportional to the net force, but inversely proportional to its mass.</p>

<p><strong>Trajectory</strong> The path of any moving object</p>

<p><strong>Projectile</strong> An object that is given an initial force, and then allowed to move freely through space</p>

<p><strong>Parabola</strong> The name given to the shape of a curve which a projectile follows when gravity is the only force acting upon it</p>

<p>In the real world air resistance also acts on projectiles, however this is ignored in order to allow the problems to be solved using the constant acceleration equations.</p>

<p>To solve a problem, the components of motion are split into two parts, horizontal and vertical.</p>



<h3 id="measurement-of-g">Measurement of g</h3>

<p><strong>Light gate</strong> A device which measures the time between a beam of light being broken and being restored.</p>

<p><strong>Motion sensor</strong> Record displacement at regular time intervals</p>

<p>Both of these devices can be used to determine an experimental value for <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5778">g</script>.</p>

<p>Measurements can either be direct or indirect</p>

<ul>
<li>Direct measurement is measurement which does not require manipulation, such as time a falling object</li>
<li>Indirect measurement requires manipulation, such as measuring the period of pendulum and rearranging to find <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5779">g</script></li>
</ul>

<p>When explaining an investigation, state the following</p>

<ul>
<li>The measurements to be taken</li>
<li>The equipment with which to take the measurements</li>
<li>The variables required to determine <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5780">g</script></li>
<li>The sources of uncertainty in the measurements</li>
<li>The possible methods to minimise uncertainty</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="required-method-use-of-a-trap-door-and-an-electromagnet-to-determine-g">Required method- Use of a trap door and an electromagnet to determine <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6039">g</script></h4>

<p><strong>Equipment</strong> <br>
An electromagnet supports a steel ball.  <br>
The electromagnet is on the same circuit as a timer.</p>

<p><strong>Procedure</strong></p>

<p>When a switch is toggled the ball begins to fall a known distance, and the timer on the same circuit begins.</p>

<p>The ball falls onto a trap door, stopping the timer.</p>

<p><strong>Calculation</strong></p>

<p>The variables are the distance fallen, s, and the time taken, t.</p>

<p>Using the constant acceleration acceleration <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6040">s = \frac{1}{2} at^2</script></p>

<p>For any values of s and t we can then find a value for acceleration due to gravity.</p>

<p>Alternatively we could use the inferior and inaccurate method of drawing a graph of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6041">s</script> against <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6042">t^2</script> which would have a gradient of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6043">\frac{a}{2}</script>.</p>

<p><strong>Methods to increase accuracy and reduce error</strong></p>

<p>In order to increase the accuracy of the experiment we could take repeat readings to find a mean value for <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6044">t</script>, and measure t across different heights.</p>

<h3 id="car-stopping-distances">Car stopping distances</h3>

<p><strong>Stopping distance</strong> The total distance that a vehicle travels before it stops</p>

<p><strong>Thinking distance</strong> The distance a vehicle travels between the operator seeing the hazard and applying the brakes</p>

<p><strong>Braking distance</strong> The distance that a vehicle travels between its brakes being applied and it coming to rest</p>

<h3 id="force-and-the-newton">Force and the Newton</h3>

<p><strong>Resultant force</strong> A single force which has the same effect as the sum of all forces acting on a body <br>
<strong>Thrust</strong> A term used for the driving force provided by a jet engine <br>
<strong>Drag</strong> A force which acts in the opposite direction to motion, impeding it. Also called the dissipative force</p>

<p>Types of forces</p>

<ul>
<li>Contact- Two bodies touch when their repulsive molecular forces equal the force that is trying to bring them together</li>
<li>Friction- When two bodies are in contact their attractive molecular forces try to prevent their common surfaces moving relative to each other</li>
<li>Tension- The force exerted by a body when it is stretched. It is due to attractive molecular forces</li>
<li>Compression- The force exerted by a body when it is compressed. It is due to repulsive molecular forces</li>
<li>Fluid upthrust- The force exerted by a fluid on a body because of the weight of the fluid that has been displaced by the body. Archimedesâ€™ principle states that the upthrust force is equal to the weight of fluid displaced.</li>
<li>Electrostatic- Attractive and repulsive forces due to bodies being charged</li>
<li>Magnetic- Attractive and repulsive forces due to moving electric charges</li>
<li>Electromagnetic- Attractive and repulsive forces due to bodies being charged. Contact, friction, tension, compression, fluid upthrust, electrostatic, and magnetic forces are all forms of electromagnetic foce</li>
<li>Weak nuclear- The force responsible for nuclear decay</li>
<li>Electro-weak- It is thought that both the electromagnetic and weak nuclear forces are both forms of this fundamental force</li>
<li>Strong nuclear- This fundamental force holds protons and neutrons together in the nucles</li>
<li>Gravitational- The fundamental force exerted on a body due to its mass</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="dynamics">Dynamics</h3>

<p><strong>Dynamics</strong> A branch of mechanics concerned with the motion of bodies under the action of forces</p>

<p>While dynamics is the study of the motion of bodies and the forces that cause the movement, kinematics is the study of movement without any reference to external forces.</p>

<p>The normal contact force, or reaction force, acts perpendicular to the point of contact against a surface.</p>

<p>When two surfaces move next to each other, each surface is slightly deformed, meaning that the bonds between the atoms are stretched and compressed.</p>

<p>Friction occurs within all fluids.</p>



<h4 id="free-body-diagrams">Free body diagrams</h4>

<p>Free body diagrams help to determine the net force on a body</p>

<p>They should always contain</p>

<ul>
<li>The body or point upon which the forces are acting</li>
<li>The direction in which each force acts</li>
<li>The type of each force</li>
<li>The size of each force</li>
</ul>

<p>The diagram below shows the free body diagram for an object on a rough inclined plane</p>

<p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/lMCD8.png" alt="Free body diagram" title=""></p>



<h3 id="drag-and-terminal-velocity">Drag and terminal velocity</h3>

<p><strong>Fluid</strong> A substance which has no fixed shape, and yields easily to external pressure</p>

<p>Any object which moves through a fluid experiences a dissipative drag force. <br>
The drag force is called aerodynamic drag when the fluid is a gas, and hydrodynamic drag when the fluid is a liquid.</p>

<p>The frictional force on a body moving through a fluid is given by </p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6357">F_d = \frac{1}{2} \rho C_d AV^2</script></p>

<p>Where  <br>
<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6358">F_d</script> is the drag force <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6359">(\text{N})</script> <br>
<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6360">\rho</script> is the density of the fluid <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6361">(\text{kg m}^{-3})</script> <br>
<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6362">C-d</script> is the coefficient of drag <br>
<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6363">A</script> is the cross sectional area of the object <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6364">(\text{m}^2)</script> <br>
<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6365">V</script> is the velocity of the object <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6366">(\text{m s}^{-1})</script></p>

<p>For an object of constant size, moving through a fluid of uniform density the drag force, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6367">F_d</script>, is proportional the the square of the velocity, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6368">V^2</script>.</p>

<h4 id="terminal-velocity">Terminal velocity</h4>

<p>When an object falls from a height, it initially accelerates because the force of gravity is greater than the resistive force. <br>
As it accelerates, its velocity increases, and as such the drag force increases proportional to the square of the velocity (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5793">F_d \propto V^2</script>). The increase in drag force results in a decrease in acceleration.</p>

<p>When the drag force is equal to the force of gravity, the object is at terminal velocity.</p>



<h3 id="equilibrium">Equilibrium</h3>

<p><strong>Equilibrium</strong> If the resultant force acting on an object is 0, the object is said to be in equilibrium</p>

<p>The resultant force can be found by splitting each of the forces acting on a body into their respective horizontal and vertical components, before finding the resultant in each axis.</p>



<h3 id="turning-forces">Turning forces</h3>

<p>The turning effect of a force is called a moment</p>

<p><strong>Couple</strong> Two equal antiparallel forces acting to produce rotation with no linear motion <br>
<strong>Torque</strong> The torque of a couple is defined as the moment or turning effect produced by a couple</p>

<p>The moment is the force multiplied by the perpendicular distance from the pivot around which it is acting</p>



<h4 id="principle-of-moments">Principle of moments</h4>

<p>The principle of moments states that when in equilibrium the sum of the clockwise moments is equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments.</p>

<p>The resultant force must also be 0 to ensure that there is no translational acceleration.</p>



<h3 id="centre-of-mass">Centre of mass</h3>

<p><strong>Centre of mass</strong> The centre of mass of an object is the single point at which all of an objects mass can be assumed to be situated. For a symmetrical body of uniform density it is always situated at the centre of the object.</p>



<h4 id="method-for-determining-the-mass-of-irregular-shapes">Method for determining the mass of irregular shapes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Make two holes in the objects</li>
<li>Hang the object from each of the holes and draw a line from the hole parallel to the ground</li>
<li>The centre of mass is the point at which the lines cross</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Centre of gravity</strong> The centre of gravity is the single point through which the entire weight of the object can be thought to act</p>

<p>The stability of objects are determined by the position of their centres of mass and their base area. <br>
Objects with a low centre of mass and wide base area are more stable.</p>



<h3 id="density">Density</h3>

<p><strong>Density</strong> The mass per unit volume of a substance</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6371">\rho = \frac{m}{v} \quad (\text{kg m}^{-3})</script></p>

<h3 id="pressure">Pressure</h3>

<p><strong>Pressure</strong> The force per unit area</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6374">P = \frac{F}{A} \quad \left(\frac{N}{m^2}\right) \text{(Pa}) </script></p>

<p>For hydrostatic pressure</p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6508">P = h\rho g</script> <br>
Where  <br>
<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6509">h</script> is the depth of the fluid <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6510">(\text{m})</script> <br>
<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6511">\rho</script> is the density of the fluid <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6512">(\text{kg m}^{-3})</script> <br>

<h3 id="work-and-the-joule">Work and the joule</h3>

<p><strong>Work</strong> The work done is the product of the force and the distance moved by the force in the direction of movement</p>

<p>One joule is defined as the energy exerted when a force of one newton is applied over a displacement of one metre.</p>

<p>The area under the curve of a force-distance graph is equal to the work done</p>



<h3 id="the-conservation-of-energy">The conservation of energy</h3>

<p>Forms of energy</p>

<ul>
<li>Kinetic energy- Energy possessed by a moving body</li>
<li>Nuclear energy- Energy transferred during a nuclear reaction</li>
<li>Gravitational potential energy- Energy possessed by anything under the influence of a gravitational force</li>
<li>Elastic potential energy- Energy possessed by an object which has been stretched</li>
<li>Chemical energy- Energy stored in the bonds of a molecule</li>
<li>Electrical energy- Energy due to the flow of electrons</li>
<li>Light energy- Energy possessed by electromagnetic radiation</li>

<p>2nd law of thermodynamics <br>
The entropy of any isolated system always increases</p>

<p>3rd law of thermodynamics <br>

<h3 id="potential-and-kinetic-energy">Potential and kinetic energy</h3>

<p>The kinetic energy, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5800">E_k</script> possessed by an object in motion is given by</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5801">E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 </script></p>

<p>The gravitational potential energy, GPE, stored in an object by virtue of its position in a gravitational field is given by</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5802">GPE = mg\Delta h</script></p>

<p>When an object falls under the influence of a gravitational force, its gravitational potential energy is converted into kinetic energy.</p>

<p>When an object is launched upwards with an initial velocity, and therefore an initial kinetic energy, its kinetic energy is converted to gravitational potential energy until it has 0 velocity, and begins to fall.</p>



<h3 id="power-and-the-watt">Power and the watt</h3>

<p><strong>Power</strong> The rate of work done <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6543">(\text{W})</script> <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6544">(\text{J s}^{-1})</script></p>

<p>The power produced by an object moving at speed v under a force F produces a power given by</p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5805">P = Fv</script></p>



<h3 id="efficiency">Efficiency</h3>

<p><strong>Efficiency</strong> The efficiency of a process is the ratio of useful work performed to the total energy expended</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6559">\text{Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Useful output energy}}{\text{Total input energy}}</script></p>

<h3 id="deformation-of-materials">Deformation of materials</h3>

<p><strong>Deformation</strong> The change in shape or size of an object</p>

<p><strong>Elasticity</strong> The tendency of a body to resume itâ€™s original shape or size once a deforming force or stress has  been removed</p>

<p><strong>Elastic deformation</strong> When a body returns to itâ€™s original shape once a stress, strain, or force is removed</p>

<p><strong>Plastic deformation</strong> When a body does not return to itâ€™s original shape once a stress, strain, or force is removed</p>



<h4 id="tensile-forces">Tensile forces</h4>

<p>Tensile forces  cause tension in an object. <br>
If there is tension in a wire, then   there must be an equal and opposite force at both ends. <br>
These forces will cause the wire to increase in length, a positive extension.</p>

<p>Compressive forces act towards each other and have the opposite effect.</p>



<h4 id="measuring-the-stretch-of-a-wire">Measuring the stretch of a wire</h4>

<ul>
<li>Attach a wire to a clamp</li>
<li>Run the wire horizontally, over the edge of a surface through a pulley</li>
<li>Attach mass to the wire so that it is taught</li>
<li>Place a mark on the wire, and a ruler underneath it inline with the mark</li>
<li>Progressively add more mass, measuring how far the mark moves</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="elastic-limit">Elastic limit</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.cyberphysics.co.uk/graphics/graphs/stress_strain2.gif" alt="Elastic limit" title=""></p>

<p>The important points are</p>

<ul>
<li>The limit of proportionality</li>
<li>The elastic limit</li>
<li>The fracture point</li>
<li>The plastic deformation region</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="hookes-law">Hookeâ€™s law</h3>

<p><strong>Hookeâ€™s law</strong> The extension of an object is proportional to the force that causes it, provided that the elastic limit is not exceeded</p>

<p>Hookeâ€™s law states</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6596">F = kx</script></p>

<p>The force (N) is equal to the spring constant <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6597">(\text{N m}^{-1})</script> multiplied by the extension <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6598">(\text{m})</script>.</p>

<h4 id="springs-in-series-and-combination">Springs in series and combination</h4>

<p>When springs are suspended in series, each spring experiences the same pull from the weight of the mass it supports. Therefore each spring extends the same amount as an individual spring would do.</p>

<p>When springs support a weight by combination, they share the load and therefore are not stretched as much as if they were supporting the weight themselves.</p>



<h4 id="force-extension-graphs-and-work-done">Force extension graphs and work done</h4>

<p>As stated previously, work done = force x distance. <br>
Therefore, the area under a force-extension graph is equal to the work done in applying the extension. <br>
This work done is equal to the elastic potential energy stored within the extended object.</p>

<p>Prior to the limit of proportionality, the area under the curve forms a triangle</p>

<p><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5810">W = \frac{1}{2}Fx</script></p>

<p>as <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5811">F = kx</script>, we also have </p>

<p><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5812">W = \frac{1}{2}kx^2</script></p>

<p>Usually we plot the independent variable on the x-axis, and the dependent on the y-axis. <br>
Force extension graphs break this convention.</p>

<p>If we plot extension on the x, the gradient is then the spring constant</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5813">k = \frac{\Delta F}{\Delta x}</script></p>



<h3 id="the-young-modulus">The Young modulus</h3>

<p><strong>Stress</strong> Force per unit area <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6634">(\text{N m}^{-2})\ (\text{Pa})</script>  Given the symbol <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6635">\sigma</script></p>

<p><strong>Strain</strong> Extension per unit length (Unitless) Given the symbol <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6636">\varepsilon</script></p>

<p>The young modulus is the ratio of stress to strain</p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6649">\text{Young modulus} = \frac{\text{tensile stress}}{\text{tensile strain}} \\   E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}</script></p>

<p>A stiff material needs more force to deform in comparison to a soft material. The Youngâ€™s modulus is a measure of the stiffness of a solid.</p>

<p><strong>Strength</strong> The amount of force that a material can withstand and still recover its original shape</p>

<p><strong>Hardness</strong> The relative resistance that the surface of a material imposes against the penetration of a harder body</p>

<p><strong>Toughness</strong> The amount of energy that a material can absorb before fracturing</p>

<p>As we know that</p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6656">\text{stress} = \frac{\text{force}}{\text{cross-sectional area}}</script></p>

<p>and</p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6665">\text{strain} = \frac{\text{extension}}{\text{original length}}</script></p>

<p>we can write the Youngâ€™s modulus as</p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6706">\begin{align}
\text{Young modulus} &= \frac{ \frac{\text{force}}{\text{cross-sectional area}} }{ \frac{\text{extension}}{\text{original length}}} \\ 
&= \frac{\text{force} \times \text{original length}}{\text{extension} \times \text{cross-sectional area}} \\
&= \frac{Fl}{eA} 
\end{align}</script></p>

<h4 id="investigating-young-modulus">Investigating Young modulus</h4>

<p>Searles apparatus</p>

<ul>
<li>Measures the original length of a wire before any load</li>
<li>Measures the diameter of the wire with a micrometre</li>
<li>Force of tension is then increased by adding masses to the right side</li>
<li>Extension is measured after each new mass is added</li>
<li><p>A  stress vs strain graph is plotted from the data</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgsafe.org/496b25e74f.png" alt="enter image description here" title=""></p></li>

<li>Run the wire horizontally, over the edge of a surface through a pulley</li>
<li>Attach mass to the wire so that it is taught</li>
<li>Place a mark on the wire, and a ruler underneath it inline with the mark</li>
<li>Progressively add more mass, measuring how far the mark moves</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the collected values to calculate the Young modulus of the wire</p>

<p><strong>Ultimate tensile strength</strong> The maximum stress a material can withstand while being pulled or stretched before it breaks</p>

<p><strong>Elastic hysteresis</strong> The process in which energy is dissipated by the loading and unloading of a material</p>



<h3 id="categorisation-of-materials">Categorisation of materials</h3>

<p><strong>Ductile</strong> A ductile material can be drawn into wires and will show plastic deformation under tensile stress before it breaks</p>

<p><strong>Malleable</strong> A malleable material can be hammered and beaten into flat sheets and will show extensive plastic deformation when subjected to compressive forces</p>

<p><strong>Brittle</strong> A brittle material will break with very little plastic deformation</p>

<p><strong>Polymeric</strong> A polymeric material has long chains of molecules that allow for elastic deformation</p>

<p>When a ductile material is stretched, it will increase in length and decrease in cross sectional area to compensate for this. This process is known as necking.</p>

<li>An energy source- A source of electromotive force</li>
<li>A closed path or complete circuit- For electrons to flow in a complete loop from a negative electrode to a positive electrode</li>
<li>Electrical components</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conventional current</strong> Behaves as if the positive charge carries cause current flow from the positive terminal to the negative terminal</p>

<p><strong>Electron flow</strong> As electrons are negatively charged, they flow from the negative electrode to the positive electrode</p>

<p><strong>Electric current</strong> The rate of flow of charge</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5832">I = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t} \quad (A)</script></p>

<p>where n is the number of electrons.</p>

<p>The unit of charge is the coulomb (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6715">\text{C}</script>).  <br>
One coulomb is the quantity of charge that passes a fixed point in one second when a current of one ampere is flowing</p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6722">1\text{ C} = 1\text{  A s}</script></p>

<h4 id="kirchhoffs-first-law">Kirchhoffâ€™s first law</h4>

<p>At any junction in a circuit, the sum of the currents arriving at the junction is equal to the sum of the currents leaving the junction.</p>



<h3 id="electron-drift-velocity">Electron drift velocity</h3>

<p>Electrons move in random directions. <br>
When a current is flowing, the electrons have a mean velocity in the direction of electron flow.</p>

<h4 id="the-difference-between-potential-difference-and-electromotive-force">The difference between potential difference and electromotive force</h4>

<p>p.d can be measured in several places in a circuit, across each of its components. It is the energy transferred per unit charge as they pass through the component.</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6727">p.d = \frac{\text{work done}}{\text{charge}}</script></p>

<p>e.m.f is only associated with the electrical energy source. It is the energy gained per unit charge passing through the source.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6732">e.m.f = \frac{\text{energy gained}}{\text{charge}}</script></p>

<h3 id="resistance-and-ohms-law">Resistance and Ohmâ€™s law</h3>



<h4 id="ohms-law">Ohmâ€™s law</h4>

<p>The current through a conductor is directly proportional to the potential difference across it, provided that physical conditions, such as temperature, remain constant.</p>



<h4 id="resistance">Resistance</h4>

<p><strong>Resistance</strong> The ratio of voltage applied to a material to the current which flows through it (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5840">\Omega</script>)</p>

<p>Resistance depends upon the type of material, and the volume of the material. <br>
Longer wires will have a smaller potential gradient. The longer the wire, the lower the â€˜voltage per metreâ€™. This will lower the drift velocity and hence result in a smaller current.  <br>
This means that the resistance of the wire increases in direct proportion to the length of the wire.</p>

<p>Resistance is inversely proportional to the cross sectional area of the wire. There is no change in potential gradient, but there is a large volume of electrons that are available to flow at the same drift velocity.</p>

<p>Resistance also depends on the temperature of the wire. <br>
When the temperature increases, the fixed metal ions vibrate more creating an obstacle for the flow of electrons.</p>



<h3 id="resistivity">Resistivity</h3>

<p><strong>Resistivity</strong> A measure of the resisting power of a material to the flow of electric current through it</p>

<p>Resistivity applies to a particular component.  <br>
While resistance is measured in ohms <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6975">(\Omega)</script>, resistivity is measured in ohm metres <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6976">(\Omega\text{m})</script></p>

<h3 id="parallel-circuits">Parallel circuits</h3>



<h4 id="resistance-in-parallel-circuits">Resistance in parallel circuits</h4>

<h3 id="ammeters-and-voltmeters-in-circuits">Ammeters and voltmeters in circuits</h3>



<h4 id="ammeters">Ammeters</h4>

<p>Ammeters are always connected in series with components to measure the size of the current flowing through them. Ammeters are designed to have negligible resistance.</p>



<h4 id="voltmeters">Voltmeters</h4>

<p>Voltmeters are always arranged in parallel with components in a circuit. They are designed to have close to infinite resistance so that none of the current flows through them.</p>



<h3 id="the-potential-divider">The potential divider</h3>

<p><strong>Potential divider</strong> A circuit which uses two resistors to split up or divide the voltage of the supply in a chosen ratio </p>

<p><img src="http://www.allaboutcircuits.com/uploads/thumbnails/voltage-divider-main-circuit.png" alt="Potential divider" title=""></p>

<p>The size of the output voltage is given by</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6997">V_{\text{out}} = V_{\text{in}} \times \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}</script></p>

<p>The ratio of the potential differences across each of the resistors is equal to the ratio of the resistances of the resistors.</p>

<h4 id="using-a-variable-resistor">Using a variable resistor</h4>

<p>The potential divider can be used with a variable resistor across the output voltage, allowing <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6999">V_{\text{out}}</script> to be easily adjusted.</p>

<h4 id="using-a-thermistor-in-a-temperature-control-circuit">Using a thermistor in a temperature control circuit</h4>

<p>If a thermistor is used across <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7000">V_{\text{out}}</script>  the circuit can be used to control a heater on an on/off cycle.</p>

<h4 id="using-a-light-dependent-resistor-in-an-illumination-control-circuit">Using a light-dependent resistor in an illumination control circuit</h4>

<p>An LDR has a high resistance when the incident light intensity is very low. As the intensity of the falling light increases the resistance falls. <br>
This means that the LDR can be used to switch lights on as the incident light decreases.</p>



<h3 id="internal-resistance">Internal resistance</h3>

<p><strong>Internal resistance</strong> The internal resistance of a source of e.m.f is the resistance to electric current of the materials inside a cell</p>

<p><strong>Terminal p.d</strong> The potential difference recorded across the terminals of a cell. </p>

<p><strong>Lost volts</strong> The difference between e.m.f and the terminal p.d when charge flows in a cell</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5867">\begin{align} \mathscr{E} &= IR + Ir \\ &= I(R + r) \\ &= V_R + Ir\end{align}</script></p>

<p>So when no current flows, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5868">I = 0</script> and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5869">\varepsilon = V_R</script></p>

<p>The e.m.f and internal resistance of a cell are constant values. It is therefore possible to have a situation in which different currents will flow for different load resistances. <br>
The values can be solved using simultaneous equations.</p>



<h4 id="finding-the-internal-resistance-of-a-cell">Finding the internal resistance of a cell</h4>

<p>I we rearrange <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5870">\varepsilon = IR + Ir</script> and substitute <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5871">V_R</script> for <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5872">IR</script> we have <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5873">V_R = -Ir + \varepsilon</script> .</p>

<p>This equations has the form <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5874">y = mx + c</script>, so if we plot a graph of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5875">V</script> against <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5876">I</script> we will have a straight line with negative gradient and positive intercepts. <br>
The <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5877">y</script> intercept will be equal to the e.m.f of the cell. <br>
The gradient of the graph equals the internal resistance of the cell.</p>



<h3 id="circuit-analysis">Circuit analysis</h3>



<h4 id="analysis-of-series-and-parallel-hybrid-circuits">Analysis of series and parallel hybrid circuits</h4>

<p>Many circuits have a parallel branch that is connected in series with other components.  <br>
It is helpful to calculate the resistance of the parallel network first, before adding it to the resistance of the other components that are connected in series with it.</p>



<h4 id="series-circuits-involving-two-sources-of-emf">Series circuits involving two sources of e.m.f</h4>

<p>If two sources of e.m.f have opposite polarities the overall e.m.f can be found by taking one source to be the negative direction and summing them.</p>



<h4 id="parallel-circuits-involving-two-sources-of-emf">Parallel circuits involving two sources of e.m.f</h4>

<p>The overall e.m.f available to the circuit can be found in the same manner as for a series circuit.</p>

<p>To calculate the combined effective resistance of the network, arrange as would normally be done for a parallel circuit.</p>



<h3 id="wave-motion">Wave motion</h3>

<p>Waves transfer energy from one place to another without any net transfer of matter.</p>

<p>Waves can be longitudinal or transverse.  <br>
In longitudinal waves the vibrations are parallel to the direction of energy transfer, resulting in the formation of compressions and rarefactions. <br>
In transverse waves the vibrations are perpendicular to the direction of energy transfer.</p>

<p><strong>Progressive waves</strong> Waves which transfer energy away from a source</p>



<h3 id="wave-terminology">Wave terminology</h3>

<p><strong>Wavelength</strong> The wavelength, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7323">\lambda (\text{ m} )</script> of a wave is the distance between two successive identical points that have the same pattern of oscillation.</p>

<p><strong>Period</strong> The period, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7324">T\ (\text{s})</script>, is the time taken for the wave to complete one pattern of oscillation</p>

<p><strong>Frequency</strong> The frequency, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7325">f\ (\text{Hz})</script>, is the number of oscillations per unit time at any point. It is the inverse of the period of the wave</p>

<p><strong>Displacement</strong> The displacement, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7326">x\ (\text{m})</script>, is the distance of any part of the wave from its mean position</p>

<p><strong>Amplitude</strong> The amplitude, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7327">x_0\ (\text{m})</script>, is the maximum displacement that the wave reaches from its mean position</p>

<p><strong>Phase difference</strong> The phase difference, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7328">\varphi\ (\text{rad})</script>, the difference in the pattern of vibration between two points in the wave. Two points that have exactly the same pattern of oscillation are said to be in phase, there is zero phase difference between them</p>

<h3 id="using-an-oscilloscope">Using an oscilloscope</h3>

<p>An oscilloscope displays a voltage-time signal and can be used as a voltmeter to display and measure the output from a microphone or signal generator.</p>

<p>The frequency of a wave displayed on an oscilloscope can be determined if you know the settings of the time base on the oscilloscope. <br>
This is the time taken for the luminous dot produced by the CRT to move a horizontal distance of 1cm across the oscilloscopeâ€™s screen.</p>



<h4 id="oscilloscope-controls">Oscilloscope controls</h4>

<p>Each horizontal division on the oscilloscope represents a unit of time. The time base control varies the seconds or milliseconds per division. <br>
The uncertainty in the frequency measurement can be reduced by altering the time base such that one full wave has the widest possible range in the x direction.</p>

<p>If the time base is turned off, the spot no longer moves across the screen. This is useful for observing the intensity of the wave.</p>

<p>Each vertical division on the oscilloscope screen represents a unit of voltage. The sensitivity control varies the volts per division.</p>



<h3 id="wave-speed-and-the-wave-equation">Wave speed and the wave equation</h3>



<h4 id="the-wave-equation">The wave equation</h4>

<p><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7429">\text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} </script> can also be applied to movement</p>

<p>In a time equal to one period, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7430">T</script>, the wave travels one wavelength, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7431">\lambda</script>. Therefore the speed, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7432">v</script>, of the wave is</p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5894">v = \frac{\lambda}{T}</script></p>

<p>We know that the frequency is the reciprocal of the period, so this can also be written</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5895">v = f \times \lambda</script></p>



<h4 id="energy-transfer-by-waves">Energy transfer by waves</h4>

<p>A progressive wave transfers energy from one place to another. From a point source producing waves, this energy spreads out in all directions.</p>

<p><strong>Intensity</strong> Power per unit area <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7438">(\text{W m}^{-2})</script></p>

<p>The intensity is given by</p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-7454">\begin{align} \text{intensity} = \frac{\frac{\text{energy}}{\text{time}}}{\text{area}} \\ = \frac{\text{power}}{\text{area}}\end{align}</script></p>

<p>If the power spreads out equally in all directions this can be written</p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-7458">\text{intensity} = \frac{\text{power}}{4\pi r^2}</script></p>

<h4 id="intensity-and-amplitude">Intensity and amplitude</h4>

<p>The amplitude of a wave decreases as the wave spreads out from a source.  <br>
The energy of a wave is proportional to the square of its amplitude. Hence the intensity of a progressive wave is also proportional to the square of its amplitude. <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5899">I \propto A^2 </script></p>



<h3 id="common-properties-of-waves">Common properties of waves</h3>



<h4 id="reflection">Reflection</h4>

<p>All waves can be reflected.</p>

<p><strong>Ray</strong> A single line to illustrate the direction of a waves travel. Rays are always drawn at right angles to the wavefronts.</p>



<h4 id="refraction">Refraction</h4>

<p>Refraction occurs when a wave moves from one material into another. <br>
In terms of refraction of light, we say that the two materials have different optical densities.</p>

<p>Two observations an be made when refraction occurs</p>

<ul>
<li>The wave will change its speed</li>
<li>There may be a change in direction</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="investigating-refraction-and-reflection-in-a-ripple-tank">Investigating refraction and reflection in a ripple tank</h4>

<p>In a ripple tank, a motorised straight edge bar produces plane waves, while a small dipper produces circular waves. <br>
When light is shone from above through the waves produced, the bright bands or curves of light seen on on the screen below the tank show the wave crests. This makes it possible to measure the wavelength of the water waves, and investigate the angles of reflection and refraction.</p>

<p>Reflection at plane and curved surfaces can be investigated, and the angles of incidence and reflection measured with respect to the normal.</p>

<p>A glass sheet is used to decrease the water depth and so produce a region with a different wave speed. The water level can also be adjusted. <br>
If the separation of the wavefronts decreases this shows they are travelling more slowly. If the wavefronts are at non-zero angle when they cross the barrier, the waves also changes direction.</p>



<h4 id="diffraction">Diffraction</h4>

<p><strong>Diffraction</strong> The spreading out of a wave after passing around an obstacle or through a gap</p>

<p>Diffraction is most pronounced when the wavelength of the wave being diffracted is the same size as the gap that they are travelling through.</p>



<h4 id="interference">Interference</h4>

<p><strong>Interference</strong> The addition of two more more waves (superposition) that results in a new wave pattern</p>



<h3 id="electromagnetic-waves">Electromagnetic waves</h3>



<h4 id="common-properties-of-electromagnetic-waves">Common properties of electromagnetic waves</h4>

<p>The electromagnetic spectrum has a range of values for wavelength of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7888">10^{-16}</script> to <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7889">10^4 \text{ m}</script>.</p>

<p>Visible light is a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from approximately <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7890">370 \text { nm}</script> for violet to <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7891">740 \text{ nm}</script> for red.</p>

<p>All electromagnetic waves share the following properties</p>

<ul>
<li>They can travel through a vacuum</li>
<li>They possess both a magnetic wave and an electrical wave interlocked perpendicular to each other</li>
<li>They travel at the speed of light in free space, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7892">c = 2.98\times10^8\text{ m s}^{-1}</script></li>
<li>They are all transverse waves</li>
<li>They can all be reflected, refracted, and diffracted</li>
<li>They can all demonstrate interference</li>
<li>They can all be polarised</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="non-ionising-electromagnetic-radiation">Non-ionising electromagnetic radiation</h4>

<p>Radio waves, microwaves, and visible light do not have enough photon energy to remove electrons from the shells of atoms. For this reason they are deemed to be relatively safe.</p>



<h4 id="ionising-electromagnetic-radiation">Ionising electromagnetic radiation</h4>

<p>Ultraviolet rays, X-rays, and gamma radiation all have high photon energies. This means that they can cause ionisation. <br>
This can lead to human cell mutation and is therefore dangerous.</p>

<p>Ultraviolet radiation emitted by the Sun is often divided into three regions</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>UV-A</strong> 315-400nm causes tanning when skin is exposed. Accounts for 99% of UV light</li>
<li><strong>UV-B</strong> 280-315nm causes damage such as sunburn and skin cancer</li>
<li><strong>UV-C</strong> 100-280nm filtered out by the atmosphere and doesnâ€™t reach Earth</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="polarisation">Polarisation</h3>

<p><strong>Plane polarised wave</strong> A wave in which the oscillations of the field and the direction of travel are confined to a single plane</p>

<p><strong>Polarising filter</strong> A filter which produces plane-polarised waves by selective absorption of one component of the incident oscillations.</p>



<h4 id="rotating-the-plane-of-polarisation">Rotating the plane of polarisation</h4>

<p>A second polariser called the analyser an be used to rotate the plane of the waves polarisation to a direction parallel to its long edge.</p>

<p>If the amplitude of the light wave approaching the analyser sheet is A, then after it has had its plane of polarisation rotated by angle <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7948">\theta</script> the amplitude will be <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7949">Acos(\theta)</script> . <br>
Because the intensity of a wave is proportional to its amplitude squared, the intensity after the analyser is proportional to <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7950">cos(\theta)^2</script>.</p>

<p>This is know as Malusâ€™ law. <br>
It states that when a perfect polariser is put in a beam of polarised light, the intensity, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7951">I</script>, of the light that passes through it is given by <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7952">I = I_{\text{max}} cos(\theta)^2</script> , where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7953">I</script> is the intensity transmitted at angle <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7954">\theta</script> . <br>
Also <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7955">I_{\text{max}}</script> is the maximum intensity transmitted (at <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7956">\theta = 0</script>). <br>
This law also shows that if the analyser is at right angles to the polariser no light will pass through. This situation is known as â€˜crossed polaroidsâ€™.</p>

<h4 id="uses-of-polarisation">Uses of polarisation</h4>

<p>Polarisation can be used for strain analysis. Certain plastics, such as those used for making rulers, protractors and Sellotape, contain long chains of molecules which become aligned during manufacture. <br>
These materials are able to rotate the plane of polarisation so that the transmitted light is polarised. <br>
When these plastics are placed between two crossed polaroids, coloured images are produced that change as the plastics are stretched or squashed. This is because the rotation of the plane of polarisation is different for different wavelengths.</p>



<h3 id="refraction-of-light">Refraction of light</h3>

<p>For all types of electromagnetic radiation, the speed of the wave will decrease as it moves from a material of lower refractive index into a material of higher refractive index. <br>
The speed of an electromagnetic wave in a material is related to the refractive index of the material by</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-7978">\begin{align} \text{refractive index n} &= \frac{\text{speed of light in a vacuum}}{\text{speed of light in the material}} \\ &= \frac{c}{v} \end{align}</script></p>

<p>A vacuum has a refractive index of 1, and air has a refractive index of 1.00028 â‰ˆ 1.</p>

<h4 id="snells-law">Snellâ€™s law</h4>

<p>There is a link between the refractive indices of two materials and the directions at which the incident and refracted rays will travel with respect to the normal. <br>
An electromagnetic wave travelling at an angle, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5943">\theta_1</script>, to the normal in a material, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5944">m_1</script>, will travel at an angle, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5945">\theta_2</script>, to the normal in a second material, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5946">m_2</script>.</p>

<p>This is explained by Snellâ€™s law, which is given by</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5947">n_1 \times sin(\theta _1) = n_2 \times sin(\theta _2)</script></p>

<p>or that</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-7980">n sin(\theta) = \text{constant}</script></p>

<p>The angle of incidence and the angle of refraction are always measured to the normal line, not to the boundary.</p>

<h3 id="total-internal-reflection">Total internal reflection</h3>

<p><strong>Total internal reflection</strong> The complete reflection of a light ray reaching an interface with a less dense medium when the angle of incidence exceeds the critical value.</p>



<h4 id="the-critical-angle">The critical angle</h4>

<p>In the specific case of total internal reflection between two materials, we know that <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5949">n_1</script> is the refractive index of the material of higher refractive index. <br>
<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5950">sin(\theta_1)</script> is the sine of the critical angle.</p>

<p>The critical angle is given by</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5951">sin(C) = \frac{n_2}{n_1}</script></p>

<p>The ratio of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5952">n_2</script> to <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5953">n_1</script> must be less than 1, so <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5954">n_2 < n_1</script> . The smaller refractive index must be <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5955">n_2</script>.</p>



<h4 id="determining-the-critical-angle-for-a-transport-material">Determining the critical angle for a transport material</h4>

<p>To determine the critical angle of a material, use a semicircular shaped block of the material. <br>
Draw around the shape on a piece of paper, making a mark at the centre of the straight edge and draw a normal at that point. <br>
Shine a ray from a ray box towards the curved edge of the block in an arc until the ray emerges along the surface of the boundary between the material and air. <br>
The angle the ray makes with the normal is the critical angle.</p>

<p>The critical angle can be used to find the refractive index of the material in question using</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5956">sin(C) = \frac{1}{n}</script></p>



<h3 id="interference-1">Interference</h3>



<h4 id="the-principle-of-superposition">The principle of superposition</h4>

<p>The principle of superposition states that when two or more waves of the same type meet, the resultant wave can be found by adding the displacements of the individual waves.</p>



<h4 id="interference-2">Interference</h4>

<p>If two waves, A and B, with the same amplitude exist at the same point and are travelling in phase, the amplitude of the resultant wave will be twice that of the individual waves. This is constructive interference.</p>

<p>If the waves are in antiphase they will cancel each other out. This is destructive interference.</p>



<h4 id="coherence">Coherence</h4>

<p>Generally, waves will not be in perfect phase or antiphase. <br>
So long as the two waves have a constant phase difference, they are coherent.</p>

<p><strong>Path difference</strong> The path difference is the difference in metres between the lengths of two paths. It is often written in terms of the wavelength of two the wave</p>

<p><strong>Phase difference</strong> The phase difference is the difference in radians of the phases of two waves of the same frequency</p>

<h4 id="interference-using-sound-waves">Interference using sound waves</h4>

<p>Interference using sound waves can be demonstrated using two loudspeakers connected to the same signal generator. As you walk in front of the loudspeakers you will hear a loud sound where the sound waves reinforce one another, and a quiet sound where the waves partially cancel one another out. <br>
This variation is clear if you cover one ear. <br>
The distance between the loud and quiet regions is longer for lower frequencies.</p>



<h3 id="the-young-double-split-experiment">The Young double-split experiment</h3>

<p>The coloured patterns patterns seen on an oil spill on water are a result of the interference of light waves. <br>
In order to make measurements of the wavelength of light, two conditions must be satisfied</p>

<ul>
<li>The light must be monochromatic</li>
<li>There must be an accurate method of producing very small path differences, and of measuring these differences</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="the-experiment">The experiment</h4>

<p>Light is produced by a monochromatic source and diffracts outwards, before reaching a second set of two narrow parallel slits. <br>
The light from these two slits is coherent because it comes from a single slit.</p>

<p>When the waves reach an obstacle, alternate bright and dark vertical bands or â€˜fringesâ€™ will be seen.</p>

<p><img src="http://philschatz.com/physics-book/resources/Figure_28_03_06a.jpg" alt="enter image description here" title=""></p>

<p>For optimal results, the experiment should be carried out in a darkened room. <br>
To reduce percentage error in the fringe separation it is best to measure across all the fringes and then divide by the number of fringes. <br>
Increasing the distance from the slit to the screen will increase the fringe separation, but reduces light intensity at the screen.</p>



<h4 id="finding-the-wavelength-of-the-light-source">Finding the wavelength of the light source</h4>

<p>For constructive interference to take place, the path different must be a whole number of wavelengths. <br>
For destructive interference to take place, the waves must arrive out of phase with path difference of half a wavelength. <br>
<a href="https://postimg.org/image/fop9tkaxl/"><img src="https://s28.postimg.org/kncs83eql/double_slit.png" alt="double_slit.png" title=""></a></p>

<p>In the diagram above, the two triangles are a similar shape, so their angles are equal. <br>
If Î¸ is the angle away from the central fringe</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5957">sin(\theta)  = \frac{\lambda}{a}\quad and\ tan(\theta) = \frac{x}{D}</script></p>

<p>If the angle <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5958">\theta</script> is small enough <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5959">\sin(\theta) \approx tan(\theta)</script> so</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-7983">\frac{\lambda}{a} = \frac{x}{D} \quad \text{giving}\ \lambda = \frac{ax}{D}</script></p>

<p>The equation only applies if <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-7984">a \ll D</script> , or the angle away from the fringe is less than 10Â°.</p>

<h3 id="the-diffraction-grating">The diffraction grating</h3>

<p>A diffraction grating is a piece of optical equipment made from glass, onto which many thousands of thin, parallel, and equally spaced grooves have been engraved using a diamond. <br>
Light that passes through the grating will be diffracted at different angles based on the wavelength of the incident light and the separation of the grooves.</p>



<h4 id="multiple-slits">Multiple slits</h4>

<p>It is difficult to accurately determine wavelengths using the Young double-slit experiment. The diffraction fringes are quite blurred, which makes measuring the fringe width difficult. <br>
This can be overcome by using multiple slits. <br>
Increasing the number of slits that the light has to pass through improves the brightness and sharpness of the maxima and makes it easier to measure an accurate value for the wavelength of light. <br>
The maxima are also further apart, so the angle can be measured with a lower percentage uncertainty.</p>

<p>Because the length of n wavelengths, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5962">n\lambda</script>, must be equal to , we get the diffraction equation</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5963">n\lambda = d sin(\theta)</script></p>

<p>where n is called the order of the maximum, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5964">\lambda</script> is the wavelength of the incident monochromatic light, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5965">d</script> is the separation of the slits in the grating, and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5966">\theta</script> is the angle that the beam makes with the grating.</p>



<h4 id="measuring-the-wavelength-of-light-using-a-diffraction-grating">Measuring the wavelength of light using a diffraction grating</h4>

<p><img src="http://www.pstcc.edu/departments/natural_behavioral_sciences/Web%20Physics/E2020D1205.gif" alt="enter image description here" title=""></p>

<p>The wavelength is found using <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5967">n\lambda = dsin(\theta)</script>. If the grating has <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5968">X</script> slits per metre the slit spacing, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5969">d</script>, is the reciprocal of this value. <br>
The angle <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5970">\theta</script> is found with a protractor. The percentage uncertainty in <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5971">\theta</script> is decreased if <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5972">\theta</script> is as large as possible. This occurs for smaller slit separations and also for higher order fringes, however the intensity of the higher order fringes is lower, making them difficult to locate.</p>

<p><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5973">\theta</script> could also be found geometrically, using <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5974">tan(\theta) = \frac{x}{D}</script>, where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5975">x</script> is the distance from the central maxima and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5976">D</script> is the distance of the grating from the screen.</p>



<h3 id="stationary-waves">Stationary waves</h3>

<p>It is possible to confine a wave, and its energy to a fixed position. These waves are called standing or stationary waves.  <br>
Examples include waves on strings, such as stringed instruments, and air columns in tubes or pipes.</p>

<h4 id="formation-of-stationary-waves">Formation of stationary waves</h4>

<p>Stationary waves are produced by interference in accordance with the principle of superposition. <br>
In order for a stationary wave to be produced on a string or in a pipe, the two waves that overlap must be travelling in opposite directions, have the same frequency, and approximately equal amplitudes.</p>

<p>The process</p>

<ul>
<li>Initially there are two progressive waves moving in opposite directions</li>
<li>The two waves are in antiphase, with a phase difference of 180Â° or Ï€ rad</li>
<li>This leads to a resultant wave of amplitude zero</li>
<li>As the waves move, they move into phase and they create constructive interference to produce a wave with an amplitude equal to the sum of the amplitudes of the individual waves</li>
<li>The wave pattern for a whole cycle returns the waves to their original states</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Node</strong> A node in a stationary wave is a point at which there is no displacement of the particles at any time</p>

<p><strong>Antinode</strong> An antinode in a stationary wave is a point at which the displacement of the particles varies by the maximum amount</p>

<p><img src="http://www.mrsciguy.com/Physics/Waves/images/standingwaves3.gif" alt="enter image description here" title=""></p>



<h3 id="stationary-wave-experiments">Stationary wave experiments</h3>



<h4 id="stationary-waves-on-strings">Stationary waves on strings</h4>

<p>The frequency of vibration of a string is governed by</p>

<ul>
<li>Its mass per units length</li>
<li>Its tension</li>
<li>The length of the string</li>
</ul>

<p>The effect of bowing a violin string is to create progressive transverse waves that travel in opposite directions along the string away from the bow. When these waves reach the points where the string is fixed to the body of the violin, they are reflected back along the string. They then interfere with each other producing a stationary wave.</p>

<p>A stationary wave in a guitar string obeys the equation</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-8132">f = \frac{1}{2}L \sqrt{\frac{T}{\mu}}</script></p>

<p>where <br>
<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8133">f</script> is the frequency of vibration (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8134">\text{Hz}</script>) <br>
<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8135">L</script> is the length of the string (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8136">\text{m}</script>) <br>
<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8137">T</script> is the tension in the string (<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8138">\text{N}</script>) <br>
<script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8139">\mu</script> is the mass per unit length of the string <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8140">(\text{kg m}^{-1})</script></p>

<h4 id="fundamental-mode-of-vibration-and-harmonics">Fundamental mode of vibration and harmonics</h4>

<p>The simplest type of stationary wave on a string is a wave with a wavelength equal to twice the length of the string. <br>
This type of oscillation is called the fundamental mode of vibration. The fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency, highest wavelength that can be produced on a string. However other notes of higher frequency can also be produced, and these are called harmonics.</p>

<p>The frequency of a harmonic is always an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency.</p>

<h3 id="stationary-longitudinal-waves">Stationary longitudinal waves</h3>



<h4 id="stationary-waves-in-closed-tubes">Stationary waves in closed tubes</h4>

<p>A stationary longitudinal wave is a specific type of stationary wave, created by blowing across one end of a tube. <br>
As with the stationary wave produced on a string, the stationary wave in the tube is produced when progressive waves travel in opposite directions through one another.</p>

<p>A progressive wave can be started at one end of a closed tube by blowing across the open end. This wave travels down the tube and is reflected at the closed end. This produces two progressive waves travelling in opposite directions, which then interfere to produce a stationary wave. <br>
However, to produce a stationary wave the length of the tube must be such that a node is formed at the closed end, and an antinode at the open end.</p>

<p><img src="http://hep.physics.indiana.edu/~rickv/pipe_3.gif" alt="enter image description here" title=""></p>



<h4 id="stationary-waves-in-closed-tubes-1">Stationary waves in closed tubes</h4>

<p>The sound wave will also be reflected at the open ends of a pipe. Since the tube is open at both ends, each end is an antinode.</p>



<h3 id="measuring-the-speed-of-sound-in-air">Measuring the speed of sound in air</h3>

<p>The speed of sound in air can be measured using a tuning fork and a tube of water.</p>

<p>The tube is held by a clamp and is movable so that its length can be altered. Because of the water in the measure cylinder, the tube is effectively closed at one end.</p>

<p>When a tuning fork of known frequency is struck and held at the open end, air molecules in the tube will vibrate and a stationary wave will be set up in the table. <br>
By listening carefully, the fundamental frequency can be obtained, when the sound is loudest at the minimum length. This is achieved when the length of the tube is equal to one quarter <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5982">\lambda</script>.</p>

<p>The tube can then be lengthened by loosening the clamp, and the loudness of the sound will reduce initially before increasing again to a second maximum loudness when the length of the tube is equal to <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5983">\frac{3\lambda}{4}</script>. The difference between these two lengths is equal to half the wavelength of the sound, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-5984">\frac{\lambda}{2}</script>, and the speed of sound can be determined by multiplying this value by two, and then by the frequency of the tuning fork.</p>

<h3 id="the-photon">The photon</h3>

<p><strong>Quantum</strong> A small discrete unit of energy</p>

<p><strong>Photon</strong> A quantum associated with electromagnetic radiation</p>

<p><strong>Planck constant</strong> The Planck constant, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8151">h</script>, has a value of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8152">6.626\times10^{-34}\text{ J s}</script>. Photon energies are always emitted in multiples of this value </p>

<p>The equation relating the speed of light, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8153">c</script>, the frequency of the wave, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8154">f</script>, and its wavelength, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8155">\lambda</script>, is </p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-8162">\text[wave speed} = \text{frequency} \times \text{wavelength}</script></p>

<p>or </p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-8166">c = f\lambda</script></p>

<p>Rearranging this equation and substituting <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8167">E = hf</script> gives an alternative equation for calculating the energy of a photon</p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5992">E = \frac{hc}{\lambda}</script></p>



<h4 id="using-leds-to-determine-a-value-for-the-planck-constant">Using LEDs to determine a value for the Planck constant</h4>

<p>LEDs come in a range of colours. Because the colour or wavelength of the light being emitted is related to photon energy, we can use different LEDs to determine a value for the Planck constant. <br>
We need the following equipment</p>

<ul>
<li>Four LEDs of different colours and known wavelenghts</li>
<li>A <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8223">6\text{ V}</script> DC power supply</li>
<li>An ammeter and a voltmeter</li>
<li>A <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8224">1\text{ k}\Omega</script> resistor</li>
</ul>

<p>The apparatus is set up with the LED, power supply, ammeter and resistor in series, and the voltmeter in parallel across the LED.</p>

<p>We can then measure the current flowing as we increase the p.d across the LED by adjusting the variable resistor. Obtain at least six values for <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8225">\text{V}</script> and <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8226">\text{I}</script>, in steps of <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-8227">0.05\text{ V}</script> over the range where the LED starts to emit light.</p>

<p>We then determine the activation voltage for each LED. <br>
Using these values to plot a graph of activation voltage against the reciprocal of the respective wavelength, we achieve a graph with a gradient of </p>

<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5998">\frac{\Delta V}{\Delta \frac{1}{\lambda}} = \frac{hc}{e}</script></p>

<p>The energy of a photon is equal to the energy of the electrons that are excited in the semiconductor material of the LED</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-5999">eV = \frac{hc}{\lambda}</script></p>

<p>which can be rearranged to</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6000">V = \frac{hc}{e} \frac{1}{\lambda}</script></p>

<p>Comparing this to the form of a straight line graph, we can see that <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6001">h</script> is the gradient of the graph multiple by a constant</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6002">\frac{e}{c}</script></p>

<p>If we measure the gradient of the graph of activation voltage against the reciprocal of wavelength, and then multiply by the charge on an electron before dividing by the speed of light, we find a value for <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6003">h</script>.</p>

<h3 id="the-photoelectric-effect">The photoelectric effect</h3>

<p>When electromagnetic radiation of a particular frequency is shone on the surface of a metal, electrons are emitted from its surface. <br>
This phenomenon is known as the photoelectric effect, and electrons that are released are called photoelectrons.</p>



<h4 id="demonstrating-the-photoelectric-effect-with-a-gold-leaf-electroscope">Demonstrating the photoelectric effect with a gold-leaf electroscope</h4>

<p>The gold-leaf electroscope is composed of a brass stem to which a thin gold leaf is attached. There is a metal cap attached to the top of the stem and the metal to be irradiated with electromagnetic radiation is placed on the metal cap.</p>

<p>A metal plate (usually zinc is placed on the metal and is then charged negatively by touching it with a negatively charged polythene rod, or by electrostatic induction. <br>
When this is done the metal stem and gold leaf will also become negatively charged, meaning that the stem and the leaf will repel each other.</p>

<p>It is also possible to make the zinc plate, metal stem, and the gold leaf positively charged.</p>



<h4 id="observations-of-the-photoelectric-effect">Observations of the photoelectric effect</h4>

<p>When visible light is incident on a positively charged metal plate, there is no movement of the gold leaf. The same is also true when UV light is shone on the positively charged plate.</p>

<p>Shining visible light on the negatively charged zinc plate also causes no movements in the gold leaf. No matter how bright or intense the visible light is, no movement of the gold leaf is observed.</p>

<p>However, when UV light is shone on the negatively charged zinc plate, the gold leaf falls.</p>

<p>This shows that the metal plate loses its negative charge through the emission of electrons, which are repelled by the negative charge on the electroscope. The discharge of the electroscope cannot be caused by ions in the air, because the electroscope is in a sealed vacuum.</p>

<p>Further experiments show that</p>

<ul>
<li>Electrons will be emitted from the surface of a metal only if the incident radiation is above a minimum frequency called the threshold frequency. This is determined by the metal itself. Below this frequency, no electrons are emitted.</li>
<li>Emission of electrons starts the instant the surface starts to be irradiated, provided that the incident radiation exceeds the threshold frequency.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Threshold frequency</strong> The lowest frequency of radiation that will result in the emission of electrons from a particular metal surface</p>



<h3 id="explaining-the-photoelectric-effect">Explaining the photoelectric effect</h3>



<h4 id="the-work-function">The work function</h4>

<p>In order for electrons to be released from the metal, the frequency of the incident radiation must exceed the threshold frequency. This is needed to provide at least the minimum energy required to release an electron from the surface.</p>

<p><strong>Work function</strong> The work function of a metal is the minimum energy required to release an electron from its surface, overcoming the electrostatic attraction between the electron and the positive metal ions</p>

<p>When an incident photon collides with the metal</p>

<ul>
<li>If <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6010">hf < \phi</script> there is no emission of electrons</li>
<li>If <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6011">hf_0 < \phi</script> an electron is released, but it has zero kinetic energy</li>
<li><script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6012">hf > \phi</script> an electron with <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6013">E_k > 0</script> is released from the metal surface</li>
</ul>

<p>As the intensity of the radiation is increased, more electrons are released, but their kinetic energy does not increase.</p>



<h3 id="calculations-with-the-photoelectric-effect">Calculations with the photoelectric effect</h3>



<h4 id="determining-the-maximum-kinetic-energy-of-photoelectrons">Determining the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons</h4>

<p>We can equate the work done to accelerate or decelerate charged particles with the kinetic energy transferred to the electrons</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6014">eV = \frac{1}{2}mv^2</script></p>

<p>At the stopping potential, all the emitted electrons have been brought to rest, so we obtain a value for the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons by multiplying the stopping potential <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6015">V_0</script> by the charge on an electron, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6016">e</script>.</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-8258">eV_0 = KE_{\text{max}}</script></p>

<h4 id="rate-of-emission-of-electrons">Rate of emission of electrons</h4>

<ul>
<li>The number of emitted photoelectrons is directly proportional to the intensity of the incident radiation, provided that the radiation is of a single frequency and is above the threshold frequency</li>
<li>The kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons is not affected by the intensity of the incident radiation</li>
<li>The kinetic energy of the emitted photoelectrons is affected by the frequency of the incident photons. If the frequency of the incident radiation is increased, the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons also increases</li>
</ul>



<h4 id="millikans-photoelectric-experiment">Millikanâ€™s photoelectric experiment</h4>

<p>Millikan irradiated the metals sodium, potassium, and lithium with monochromatic light. By applying a positive potential to the target metal, he could decelerate the electrons. <br>
He increased the size of the potential until the most energetic electrons were unable to reach the cathode, causing the current to fall to zero. <br>
This enabled him to determine the stopping potential, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6018">V_s</script>, of each metal, and show that this depends on the frequency of the radiation.</p>

<p>Not only did Millikanâ€™s experiment obtain accurate values for the work functions of the metals, it also obtained an accurate value for Planckâ€™s constant.</p>

<p>We know that</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6019">eV_s = KE_{max}</script></p>

<p>and </p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6020">hf = \varphi + KE_{max}</script></p>

<p>If we divide both sides by the electron charge, e, and rearrange for V<sub>s</sub> we have</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6021">V_s = \left(\frac{h}{e}\right)f - \frac{\varphi}{e}</script></p>

<p>This equation is of the form <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6022">y = mx + c</script>, meaning that if we plot a graph of stopping potential, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6023">V_s</script>, against frequency, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6024">f</script>, we will have a graph of gradient <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6025">h</script> over <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6026">e</script>, and a <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6027">y</script> intercept equal to <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6028">\frac{-\varphi}{e}</script>. <br>
If we measure the gradient and multiply it by <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6029">e</script>, we get a value for Planckâ€™s constant. <br>
If we read the <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6030">y</script> intercept and multiply by <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6031">-e</script>, we get a value for the work function of the metal.</p>



<h3 id="wave-particle-duality">Wave particle duality</h3>



<h4 id="the-wavelength-of-electrons">The wavelength of electrons</h4>

<p>De Broglie proposed that if electrons and other particles travel through space as a wave, they have an associated wavelength. By combining the idea of an energy quantum with <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6032">E = mc^2</script> he derived a formula for the wavelength, <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6033">\lambda</script>, of a particle</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6034">\lambda = \frac{h}{mv}</script></p>

<p>where <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6035">m</script> is the mass of the particle, and h is the Planck constant.</p>

<p>This equation was confirmed by observing the behaviour of electrons that had been diffracted from the surface of a nickel crystal. <br>
By accelerating electrons, of charge e, through a potential difference <script type="math/tex" id="MathJax-Element-6036">V</script>, they observed a pattern of electron diffraction from which they could calculate the electronâ€™s wavelength.</p>

<p>The predicted wavelength is found by equating the work done to accelerate the electrons with the kinetic energy transferred into the electrons</p>

<p>Substituting</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6037">eV = \frac{1}{2}mv^2</script></p>

<p>into the de Broglie equation gives</p>



<p><script type="math/tex; mode=display" id="MathJax-Element-6038">\lambda = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2mVe}}</script></p>

<h4 id="wave-particle-duality-for-matter">Wave-particle duality for matter</h4>

<p>The experiment confirming De Broglieâ€™s results shows that matter could exhibit wave properties. According to De Broglieâ€™s equation, all moving objects have a wavelength, including solids. <br>
The greater the mass of the object, the shorter the wavelength, and macroscopic objects have such small wavelengths that their effects are negligible.</p>

<p>In modern physics, the wave nature of a particle is considered a probability wave. It represents the probability of an observer measuring a particle at a given place and time.</p></div></body>
